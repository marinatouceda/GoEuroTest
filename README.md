GoEuro lists the travel results sorted by cheapest, fastest or by time (departure/arrival). Please 
create an automated test that will make a search (Eg.: Berlin-Prague) and will verify that the
sorting by price is correct. 
Please send your solution as a github link. Weâ€™ll take a look at your solution considering if the 
test is working, the design choices, the commit
messages on github (best practices of version 
control) and the test report.
