# GoEuroTest
Find below the excercises requested. The resolutions will be in this repository 

1. Test case design and planning 
One of GoEuro’s most searched routes is Madrid, Spain 
-
Barcelona, Spain. Go to 
http://www.goeuro.es and perform this search. Take a look at the result page and describe how 
you would plan a test to verify this page, focusing on train results. Please list 
the tests in priority 
order. 
2. Test automation 
GoEuro lists the travel results sorted by cheapest, fastest or by time (departure/arrival). Please 
create an automated test that will make a search (Eg.: Berlin 
-
Prague) and will verify that the 
sorting 
by price is correct. 
Please send your solution as a github link. We’ll take a look at your solution considering if the 
test is working, the design choices, the commit
messages on github (best practices of version 
control) and the test report.
